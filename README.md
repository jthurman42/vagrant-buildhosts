Vagrant Buildhosts
==================

This is a simple repo so that I stop recreating when I lose them. There are
probably over 1000 ways to do this, or projects that already to it and do
it better.  BUT this is how I'm doing it right now.

Supported OSes
==============
- CentOS 6
- CentOS 5

TODO
====
- Actually install the required RPMs for packaging on bare Vagrant Boxes
